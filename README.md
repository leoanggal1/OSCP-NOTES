# OSCP-NOTES

Last July I passed the OSCP certification. I was able to pwn all the machines in the exam (100/100 points + 10 bonus points).

I publish here my notes, codes and cheatsheets taken during the preparation. I repeat, **these are only my personal notes during the study.**

Most of the information is from much better hacking sites like [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/v/es/welcome/readme), but I have adapted them to my methodology.

I am posting this because I have been asked by many colleagues and it may be useful for OSCP students. **I recommend all students not to use this as a guide and try to prepare their own notes.** 
To visualize the notes correctly I recommend using the Obsidian app. I tried to follow this template for each vulnerability I encountered. Sorry if in some of them I have not used it and for my **SPANGLISH** (some notes are written in Spanish). **I will fix the formatting and translate everything in English soon.**
